## ShowPo Page Object Model with Selenium, JavaScript, Mocha, and Chai

This is one of the companions to my Showpo regression test suite case study. It details how to test ShowPo features using the Page Object Model. POM has been chosen for the ability to rapidly swap out elements. This is important to ShowPo because they are updating the site frequently. It enables them to make their browser tests less brittle.
